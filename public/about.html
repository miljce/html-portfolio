<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A wandering soul who still hasn't found a purpose in this world. Master of Law who would do everything except in the profession. That's why I've been selling for 14 years. Communication is my middle name, so many would say that I would also sell a stone.</p>

<p>I recently started learning the code language, and I found a new occupation. I would like this to become my primary job, because this way I can express my creative side, and I will never be bored.</p>

<p>In addition, I am very dedicated to work, responsible, accurate and fair. I can play in a team, but I can also work independently. I love to drive cars and enjoy it.</p>
