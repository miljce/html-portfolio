<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A wandering soul that hasn't yet found its purpose in this world. Master lawyer who would do everything but law. A creative person since childhood, I was always interested in painting, drawing, and making jewelry.</p>
<p>Communication is my middle name. That's why I've been doing sales and marketing for 14 years. And that's what I'm doing right now.</p>
<p>However, I found something that caught my attention and that I would like to learn and improve on a daily basis. And that is the language of codes. I would like it to become my primary job because it is where I can express my creative side and constantly create something new.</p>
